# AI-BOM Workshop at RSA Conference 2024

AI software supply chain security is the bedrock of ensuring the integrity, authenticity, and resilience of AI systems throughout their lifecycle. AI-BOM, or AI Bill of Materials, is crucial for software supply chain security as it provides a comprehensive inventory of components within an AI system and properties of its security operations, MLSECOPS. AI-BOMs enable proactive measures to enhance security, mitigate threats, and maintain the integrity of AI systems. AI-BOM serves as a foundational tool for fostering trust, accountability, and resilience in the AI chain ecosystem.

Welcome to an enlightening afternoon at the AI-BOM Workshop, conveniently timed during the RSAC 2024. This exclusive workshop delves into the critical realm of AI software supply chain security. Expert speakers will illuminate key facets including AI-BOM and AI software supply chain security. Engage in collaborative discussions alongside industry leaders, shaping best practices and charting the path forward. With concluding remarks from a notable US government official from CISA.gov, this workshop ensures a comprehensive exploration of strategies to secure AI landscapes across all industries.

## Structured Group Discussion

Attendees will divide into groups, each focusing on a specific topic. The initial 5 minutes will be dedicated to introductions, during which groups will select their representative. Subsequently, each group will delve into a 10-minute discussion on their topic. Afterward, each group will present their ideas and potential hurdles in a brief 2-3 minute pitch to the rest of the participants. The remaining time will be utilized for collective brainstorming to discuss furthermore the challenges and best practices. The result from this discussion will be documented on this page.
