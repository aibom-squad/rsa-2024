# AI-BOM Workshop at RSA Conference 2024

AI software supply chain security is the bedrock of ensuring the integrity, authenticity, and resilience of AI systems throughout their lifecycle. AI-BOM, or AI Bill of Materials, is crucial for software supply chain security as it provides a comprehensive inventory of components within an AI system and properties of its security operations, MLSECOPS. AI-BOMs enable proactive measures to enhance security, mitigate threats, and maintain the integrity of AI systems. AI-BOM serves as a foundational tool for fostering trust, accountability, and resilience in the AI chain ecosystem.

Join us for an enlightening afternoon at the AI-BOM Workshop, conveniently timed during the RSAC 2024. This exclusive workshop delves into the critical realm of AI software supply chain security. Expert speakers will illuminate key facets including AI-BOM and AI software supply chain security. Engage in collaborative discussions alongside industry leaders, shaping best practices and charting the path forward. With concluding remarks from a notable US government official from CISA.gov, this workshop ensures a comprehensive exploration of strategies to secure AI landscapes across all industries.

Set within the innovative spaces of SAP Labs in San Francisco, just a stone's throw from the RSA, this workshop is the perfect pitstop for professionals looking to enrich their conference experience. As you collaborate and connect with peers, enjoy a selection of snacks to keep your energy up, sponsored by Manifest. Please note that registration is required and must be completed using your business email. We look forward to welcoming you to a productive session of learning and networking.
